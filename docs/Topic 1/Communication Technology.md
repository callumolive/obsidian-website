As mentioned briefly in [[Community]], the internet opens the door for many different avenues of conversation and communication, as well as delivering these messages at incredible speeds. This sort of communication largely began with the telegraph, ([[Scientific American - Telegraph Invention]]) which was an early instance of long distance fast communicating. History progressed leading to the radio, phone calls, and text messages, but it all began there.

The speed of which we can send and recieve messages in the modern day would have been unprecedented in the past, and is one of the most valuable things that both communication technology, and the internet has to offer.
