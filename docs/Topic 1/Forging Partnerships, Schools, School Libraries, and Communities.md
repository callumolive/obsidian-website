Linkages between schools, libraries, and communities are very important. the information provided by libraries is able to circulate amongst the community and school, which provides people with more konwledge, as well as offering a dissemination of sorts, as the vast variety of information presented in libraries can grow relationships, careers, and hobbies. public schools and their libraries specifically have been ignored by communities for some reason or another, leading to a possible lack of succesful educational systems with the lack of strong parental and community involvement programs. much of this repsonsibility falls upon the librarians themselves, as they are in the easiest position to grow partnerships and connect groups within schools and communities. Some librarians have been found to be relcutant in leaving their libraries to pursue greater connections amongst the communities, which prevents growth as they are the most knowledgable in how the libraries actually function.

Libraries should be a place where a community can come together to share their knowledge, passion, and enjoyment. A library can be a place to create contacts and cultivate relationships, for a variety of purposes (Professional, Business, Educational, School, Nonprofit Organization, IN-House, Stakeholders, etc.)

Most communities either have or have an equivalent to the different groups mentioned above. Teachers and Librarians' roles in the community must grow to become leaders, to benefit the community, and themselves. With the growth of the internet and technology as a whole, their job is one that could be at risk of replacement by a machine or artificial intelligence. By furthering their value and creating more reason behind their role, they can prevent their position from being taken by machines and technology. 

Librarians can and should be valuable soceital and communal figures, who provide and spread information to the masses.
