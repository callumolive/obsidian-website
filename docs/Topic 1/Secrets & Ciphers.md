Everyone has and keeps secrets. Certain insitutions, (governments for example), keep secrets from their civilians and wider population for the interest of public safety, or state security. These secrets are often developed into codes. Some different types of codes include: behavioural, soceital, legal, genetic, digital, and artistic codes, vernacular codes, and even religious codes. In the world of the internet, it is easier than ever to breach security. Passwords, addresses, messages and more can all be discovered online at hte touch of a button. Historically, the protection of these secrets (especially in and smongst governments) has reigned supreme over many other values. espionage and spying has taken place for centuries, in an attempt for one nation to gain the upper hand on an enemy. State secrets often are some of the most important, and most coveted pieces of information in the world. They, as a result, are almost always encoded. Sigmund Freud discovered that dreams can serve as an early example of a code. The images or things we see may represent our mental state. If you go to bed afraid, you may have a nightmare. If you sleep when you are anxious, you may feel trapped. 

With the growth of differnet types of media, it became easier for people to implant messages through codes into people's heads as well. Radio, Film, even print media all had the capability to provide subliminal messages and influence their audiences into thinking certain ways.
