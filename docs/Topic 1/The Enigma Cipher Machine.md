The enigma code was created around 1923 by the Germans, presumably for sue against the allies and other nations in what would later on come to be the second world war.

These machines would encyrpt messgae traffic, and led to them believing they created an indecipherable system, based on the vast number of options and combinations, they thought they had beat any sort of resistance or code breaking. 

The allies reprogrammed multiple different enigma machines from the germans, powered by electricity, which would counter whatever the germans would try and change. Those berakthroughs were made in Poland, and then transferred to Britain and France after Poland was taken by he germans around 1939. 

When they were able to decipher engima coded messages, it gave the allies important information for the war, including information that they'd use to storm the beaches in Normandy on D-Day.

The genius that engima imposed at it's time helped move along cryptology and cryptanalysis to where it is today, opening the door for new codes and ciphers that are nearly impossible to break. 

Enigma coded messages and the engima war in general was a very siginficant aid to the allies in winning the war
