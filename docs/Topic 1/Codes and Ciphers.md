Codes, ciphers, and secrets as a whole have existed for centuries. In an effort to secure messages and create a linguistic wall between someone and their adversary, codes would be employed to keep messages secret. As history advanced, so did codes and the code breaking. A famous example that helped contribute to the current day examples was [[The Enigma Cipher Machine]], serving a great purpose in the second world war, despite being figured out by codebreakers in Poland and other allied countries. Lingsuistic codes or "cryptology" has been used throughout human history to secure documents or important secrets. 

Governments use ciphers the most, as their information could be catastrophic if it got out. In the age of the internet it becomes increasingly difficult to secure documents with the internet being all encompassing, and with people having the ability to hack others. While that possibility is scary, online security is a newer field as a result that attmepts to find new ways of locking down cyber attacks and protecting information.
