This text mostly covers the issue of radio as a one way media device, as opposed to being able to send and recieve, shaping it into a communication system. 

They mention how important technology is in a social atmosphere and how they open opportunities for social change. communication technology itself is important for society to grow and function, as it also helps the dissemination of information and knowledge, similar to the role of libraries in communities but on a much larger scale. 

Since different communication mediums or technologies in general have different purposes or functions, especially when taking into consideration the context around them. economic and social issues or barriers greatly impact communication and communication technology or studies, so studying communication or using technology in a first world country may be normal and fine, doing those things in a very impoverished, perhaps very strict place could have very different implications.

Radio as a medium has histroically only mainly been used as a relay of sorts, whether it be a broadcast, music, news, etc. radio is a one sided form of communication technology. 

With the ease the internet allows, it can take away from difficult radio processes of the past. an "underground artist" may see their rise to notority happen much faster in the digital age, with the simplicity of generating and cultivating an audience.
